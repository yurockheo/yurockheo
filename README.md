###Hey, I'm Yurock Heo! ðŸ‘‹

I work as a back-end developer with AWS/PHP skills in NCOR. I'm based in Seoul, South Korea.

Since 2018 I've been living and breathing Python and Java but now I've moved to web development. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects. 

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm playing my favorite playlist, studying languages or simply reading a good book.

### What I'm focusing on ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ’»

Currently improving my web skills: AWS, PHP, Laravel, and MySQL.
Proficient skills: Python, Java, Matlab, and Unity.

### Find me else where ðŸš€
